### A small data science demo project for showing the relationship between CO2 and earth surface temperature

This repository contains a python script in tree formats: raw code, jupyter notebook and html format.
The code is excluding its dependencies stand alone, meaning that the most current data is automatically fetched 
when the script is run and the model is always built using the most up to date data. The file serves as a base for possible
further developement. The model and graph building code snippets could be for instance dropped in a [dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) app for web
publication. Of course some error checking and modifications would then be needed.
