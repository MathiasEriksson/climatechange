# ## Get data to model the dependency between atmospheric C0_2
# levels and temperatures on earth.
# The data-source for the temperatures is the
# "Estimated Global Land-Surface TAVG" based on the Complete Berkeley Dataset
# provided by Berkley Earth: http://berkeleyearth.org/
# The data-source for the C02 levels is the Mauna Loa dataset
# obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
#  US Department of Commerce.
